Dude, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Alarum. Holy crap, what a ride! You seen it yet? 😂 I swear, some parts were like, what the actual hell, and others, I was just like 👀. The whole thing feels like it’s running on caffeine and adrenaline, you know what I mean? Like, seriously, one minute there’s this crazy intense moment, and the next I’m laughing at how absurd everything gets. The plot... man, don’t even get me started on the plot. I feel like I need a P𝘏𝘋 to understand what I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥!

> And the characters! Haha, it’s like they were all on some super-secret mission, but nobody bothered to give ME the memo. You know those parts where I felt like they were talking around in circles, and I’m just here thinking, “Guys, can we get to the point without me needing to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   script to figure out what you’re saying?”

Also, that sound design nearly blew my freaking ears off! 😂 But I guess that’s kinda the point, right? Anyway, so, I ran out of popcorn halfway through and didn’t even care, that's how into it I was. Like, how do they come up with this stuff? Do writers just sit in a room going, “Let’s make this part just two percent more bizarre”? I don't even know, man. It’s like you’re 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a fever dream!

And the ending, geez, talk about a cliffhanger! I mean, I love a good twist as much as the next guy, but c’mon, throw me a bone at least! In any case, if you haven’t already, you gotta, no, like seriously, you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . It’s nuts. Promise you won’t regret it (or maybe you will, who knows? 😂).

Console.WriteLine(Why did I even type this out?);

So yeah, that’s my thoughts, just needed to get that off my chest before I hit the gym later. I swear these kinds of  s get me all pumped up, like pre-workout without the jitters. But anyway, let me know what you think if you check it out! 🌟
